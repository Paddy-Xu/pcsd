\section*{Question 1: Serializability \& Locking} % Question 1

\subsection*{Schedule 1}
\begin{figure}[h!]
\texttt{T1: R(X)\hspace{250pt}W(Y) C\\

Schedule one, reproduced above, corresponds to the precedence graph in figure~\ref{p1}.

    \node[main node] (2) at (-1, -1) {$T2$};

\label{p1}
\end{figure}
<<<<<<< HEAD
The precedence graph, see figure~\ref{p1}, contains a cycle between transactions: \texttt{T1,T2,T3} and is hence not conflict serializable. As schedulers using Strict two phase locking allows only conflict serializable schedules, schedule one is not conflict serializable and therefore cannot have been produced by a scheduler following Strict two phase locking.
\subsection*{Schedule 2}
=======
The precedence graph, see figure~\ref{p1}, contains a cycle between transactions: \texttt{T1,T2,T3} and is hence not conflict serializable. As schedulers using Strict two phase locking allows only conflict serializable schedules. Schedule one is not conflict serializable and therefore cannot have been produced by a scheduler following Strict two phase locking.
\subsection*{Schedule 2}

\caption{Schedule two.}
\label{sch2}
\end{figure}
Schedule two, reproduced above, corresponds to the precedence graph in figure~\ref{p2}.
\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\begin{tikzpicture}
    \node[main node] (2) at (0,1)    {$T2$};
    \node[main node] (1) at (-1, -1) {$T1$};

    (3) edge node {} (2);
\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{Precedence graph for Schedule one, see figure~\ref{sch2}.}
\label{p2}
\end{figure}
The precedence graph, see figure~\ref{p2}, is acyclic and hence is conflict serializable. In particular, schedule two is equivalent with a serial schedule where transaction two is performed last. As schedule 2 is conflict serializable, schedule 2 could be scheduled by a scheduler following Strict two phase locking. The injection of shared and exclusive locks, required if the scheduler was using Strict two phase locking, is reproduced below, figure~\ref{locks}.
\begin{figure}[h!]
\texttt{T1: S(X)\hspace{95pt}E(Y)RS(X)RE(Y)\\
T2:\hspace{105pt}S(Z)\hspace{90pt}E(X)E(Y)RS(Z)RE(X)RE(Y)\\
T3:\hspace{50pt}E(Z)RE(Z)}
\label{locks}
\caption{Shared and exclusive locks that need to be acquired in order for schedule two, see figure~\ref{sch2}, to be scheduled using Strict two phase locking. \texttt{S(Q)} acquires a shared lock on \texttt{Q} and \texttt{RS(Q)} releases the lock on \texttt{Q}, exclusive locks follow the same semantics, only with an \texttt{E}.}

\section*{Question 2: Optimistic Concurrency Control}
\subsection*{Scenario 1}
\begin{figure}[h!]
\texttt{T1: RS(T1) = \{1, 2, 3\}, WS(T1) = \{3\},\\
T1 completes before T3 starts.\\
T2: RS(T2) = \{2, 3, 4\}, WS(T2) = \{4, 5\},\\
T2 completes before T3 begins with its write phase.\\
T3: RS(T3) = \{3, 4, 6\}, WS(T3) = \{3\},\\
allow commit or rollback?}
\caption{Scenario one.}
\label{sc1}
\end{figure}
In scenario one, see figure~\ref{sc1}, we will have to rollback because of the offending object \texttt{4} in the write set of transaction two and the read set of transaction three. The conflict occurs because transaction two completes before transactions threes begins its write phase, and the intersection of their sets are non-empty.
\begin{align}
WS(T2) \cap RS(T3) &= \{4, 5\} \cap \{3, 4, 5\}\\
&= \{4\} \neq \emptyset
\end{align}
\subsection*{Scenario 2}
\begin{figure}[h!]
\texttt{T1: RS(T1) = \{2, 3, 4, 5\}, WS(T1) = \{4\},\\
T1 completes before T3 begins with its write phase.\\
T2: RS(T2) = \{6, 7, 8\}, WS(T2) = \{6\},\\
T2 completes read phase before T3 does.\\
T3: RS(T3) = \{2, 3, 5, 7, 8\}, WS(T3) = \{7, 8\},\\
allow commit or rollback?}
\caption{Scenario two.}
\label{sc2}
\end{figure}
In scenario two, see figure~\ref{sc2}, we will have to rollback of the offending object \texttt{3} in the write set of transaction one and the read set of transaction three. The conflict occurs because transaction one completes before transaction three begins its write phase, and the intersection of their sets are non-empty.
\begin{align}
WS(T1) \cap RS(T3) &= \{3\} \cap \{3, 4, 5, 6, 7\}\\
&= \{3\} \neq \emptyset
\end{align}
\subsection*{Scenario 3}
\begin{figure}[h!]
\texttt{T1: RS(T1) = \{2, 3, 4, 5\}, WS(T1) = \{4\},\\
T1 completes before T3 begins with its write phase.\\
T2: RS(T2) = \{6, 7, 8\}, WS(T2) = \{6\},\\
T2 completes before T3 begins with its write phase.\\
T3: RS(T3) = \{2, 3, 5, 7, 8\}, WS(T3) = \{7, 8\},\\
allow commit or rollback?}
\caption{Scenario three.}
\label{sc3}
\end{figure}
In scenario three, see figure~\ref{sc3}, transaction three can commit as there are no offending objects.
\begin{align}
WS(T1) \cap RS(T3) &= \{4\} \cap \{2, 3, 5, 7, 8\}\\
&= \emptyset\\
WS(T2) \cap RS(T3) &= \{6\} \cap \{2, 3, 5, 7, 8\}\\
&= \emptyset
\end{align}
\section*{Programming Task}
\subsection*{Lock implementation}
Concurrency control is achieved by a readers/writers-lock protecting all critical sections in methods accessing the book map. Methods that make no changes to the map or its entries acquire the readers lock which allows parallel access, while methods that manipulate the map have to acquire the writers lock. A \verb|ReetrantReadWriteLock| is used with the fairness parameter set to true in order to prevent starving of writers. \\
Concurrency is achieved when multiple read-operations happen in parallel, but all addition/removal of books, purchases of books and adding of copies is sequential. \\
Atomicity is achieved by always acquiring the central lock when entering the critical section of a method, so all transactions are all-or-nothing.
\\
In order to improve the performance and scalability of the locking protocol, more fine grained locking would be necessary. Currently all books are being locked in the mapping that stores them. To improve this, individual books should be locked. Stock books would instantiate their own locks when constructed, using it to ensure thread safety of their own methods. To avoid deadlocks, the locks on the books would have to be acquired in a specific order. Sorting the locks based on the ISBN of the affected books would be an option as the ISBNs are unique. Methods would acquire locks on the books one at a time, manipulating the books, then release them individually. Implementing a protocol as described would allow for concurrent manipulation of mapping of books, hence increasing the concurrency.
\subsection*{Added tests}
The implementation introduces four tests, implemented in BookStoreTest:
\subsubsection*{Test 1}
Implemented as \verb|testConcurrency1| and performs the test describes in the assignment text: one thread continously buys books while the other adds copies to the stock. The order in which execution happens is nondeterministic, but the numbers are chosen so books are never sold out, so that the final stock can be asserted to be at the initial amount.
\subsubsection*{Test 2}
Implemented as \verb|testConcurrency2|, performing the second test described in the assignment text. This is done by spawning one extra thread repeatedly buying books and adding back copies, while the main thread queries the state of the database for a set number of repetitions. It is asserted that the amount of copies are one of the two allowed amounts, and that they are both in their bought stage or in their added stage (as transactions have to be atomic). Once the desired amount of repetitions is run, the thread manipulating the books is interrupted.
\subsubsection*{Test 3}
Implemented as \verb|testConcurrency3|. Tests mutual exclusion for adding books and removing books from the store. Two threads are spawned, each repeatedly adding and removing books to/from the store. There is no set order of execution, so the main thread will assert that the database is in \emph{any} of the accepted states, meaning either all books have been added or all books have been removed. Both the \verb|getBooks| and \verb|getBooksByISBN| method are tested in this way.
\subsubsection*{Test 4}
Implemented as \verb|testConcurrency4|. This is a stress test of system, spawning five threads for each of the four methods \emph{buyBooks}, \emph{addCopies}, \emph{addBooks} and \emph{removeBooks}, which will all continously perform their operations on the system as long as the test is running. This test should in particular catch any deadlocks or other unreleased locks that might occur. The test will terminate successfully after \emph{addCopies} and \emph{addBooks} have been run for a specified amount of repetitions.
\section*{Questions for Discussion on Architecture} % Question 3
\subsection*{1.} % Question 3.1
The implemented locking protocol is equivalent to the Strict Conservative two phase locking protocol at a method level. The implemented locking protocol acquires the lock as the first part of the method call and release the lock again when the transaction is either completed or aborted. In the implemented locking protocol, methods that write to the book map will acquire an exclusive write lock on on the entire book mapping, while methods that only read will acquire a shared lock also on the entire book mapping, and hence atomicity of predicate reads are a non-issue as these would require a finer granularity in the locking protocol.
\subsection*{2.} % Question 3.2
There is only one resource to be locked down, the bookMap, and hence, as with Conservative two phase locking, the lock will always be acquired in the same, trivial order by methods, insuring deadlocks cannot happen between them.
\subsection*{3.} % Question 3.3
As mentioned in implementation section, the implementation scales poorly with a high amount of purchases or books added, as this requires an exclusive lock to the book map. In order to achieve scalability, the book-level locks described above would have to be implemented. Adding or removing books still requires locking the book table, so these methods still would not scale with this change.
\subsection*{4.} % Question 3.4
While there is an overhead in acquiring and releasing locks, the implementation still delivers read-level concurrency as a result, which should be a desirable trade-off.\\
With the book-level locking described above, the overhead from acquiring and releasing locks would increase significantly, as many locks could potentially be acquired by invoking a single method. Again, this should be an acceptable trade-off considering the amount of concurrency and scalability gained.
